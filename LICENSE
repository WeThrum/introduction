GNU AFFERO GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
                   Version 3, 19 November 2007

  Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <https://fsf.org/>
  Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
  of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

  0. This License applies to any program or other work
  which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying
  it can be distributed under the terms of this License.
  The "Program", below, refers to any such program or work,
  and a "work based on the Program" means either the Program
  or any derivative work under copyright law:
  that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion
  of it, either verbatim or with modifications, that is
  made in order to be included in the Program.

  Activities other than copying, distribution and modification
  are not covered by this License; they are outside its
  scope. The act of running the Program is not restricted,
  and the output from the Program is not covered by this
  License, except when the output is in executable form.

  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the
  Program's source code as you receive it, in any medium,
  provided that you conspicuously and appropriately publish
  on each copy an appropriate copyright notice, and there is
  a copy of this License along with the Program.

  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or
  any portion of it, and distribute copies of the modified
  Version under the terms of Section 1 above, provided that
  you also meet all of these conditions:

    a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent
    notices stating that you have changed the files and the
    date of any change.

    b) You must license the whole of your work, as a whole,
    under this License to all third parties on the same terms.

    c) If a portion of the modified Version is in a
    separate file, you must include it in the distribution.

  These requirements apply to the modified Version as a whole.
  If identifiable sections of that Version are not derived
  from the Program, and can be reasonably considered to be
  separate and independent works in themselves, then this
  License, and its terms, do not apply to those sections when
  you distribute them as separate works.

  3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work
  based on it, under Section 2) in object code or executable
  form under the terms of Section 1 above provided that
  you include a copy of this License with each copy of the
  Program.  You may also include a machine-readable copy of
  the source code.

  4. Built software supplied by you for the user's use or
  for its own distribution must include the complete sources
  of the work it is based on and executed. This requirement
  does not apply to the programs installed directly on
  the operating system.

  5. You are not required to give anyone else permission to
  run the Program, but if you do, you must pass on to them
  the same permissions you received.

  6. However, you have to combine two or more copies of the
  Program into one to be able to give them all permission,
  thus early free software meets own licensing standards.

  7. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on it),
  the recipient automatically receives a license from the original
  author to run, modify and redistribute the Program under these terms.

  8. You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of
  the rights granted or affirmed under this License.  If you cannot
  do so, please remove the portion that applies.

  9. To the extent that this License may be interpreted as
  imposing restrictions that are subsequently found by a tribunal to be invalid,
  such restrictions will be enforced to their fullest extent
  permissible, from which the other provisions in this License will continue to be valid and enforceable.

  10. If the distribution is via a network, you must include an indication of what the network required to run the Program is.

  11. This License shall be governed by the laws of the State of Massachusetts, excluding its conflict of law principles.

  12. If there is a conflict between this License and other licenses, this License shall apply.

  13. If you distribute the Program, or if you distribute a modified version, you must
  include a copy of this License with it.
